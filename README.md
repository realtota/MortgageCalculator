# MortgageCalculator
Title: GUI-based Mortgage Calculator
Overview
The GUI-based Mortgage Calculator is a user-friendly application that allows users to calculate monthly mortgage payments with ease. Built with Java and utilizing its Swing library for the graphical user interface, this application strives to enhance user interaction by providing a straightforward, visually appealing, and intuitive platform to input relevant loan details, and in return, swiftly calculate and display the corresponding monthly payment.

Languages and Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language utilized to develop the functionality and logic of the application.
Java Swing: A graphical user interface library in Java used to create visually-engaging user interfaces. It is implemented to develop all graphical components, such as text fields, buttons, labels, and panels, which comprise the application's user interface.
GridBagLayout: A flexible layout manager class in Java Swing that aligns components vertically, horizontally, or along their baseline without requiring that the components be of the same size. It was used to position elements in a grid, while still allowing for flexible component size and positioning, thus ensuring that the UI is visually balanced and well-structured.
BorderLayout: A layout manager that arranges components to fit in five regions: North, South, East, West, and Center. It is used to position the primary content in the center of the JFrame and error message label at the south (bottom) region.
Features and Functionality
User Input Fields: The application provides text fields to input essential loan details, such as loan amount, interest rate, and loan period, enhancing user interaction.

Data Validation: Implemented exception handling mechanisms to validate user inputs and ensure that they are numerical and logically valid, thereby enhancing the robustness of the application.

Calculation Logic: Utilizing mathematical formulas, the application accurately calculates the monthly payment based on user inputs and displays it promptly in the designated text field.

Visual Feedback: Users are provided with visual feedback through strategically placed labels. For instance, error messages are displayed when the input is invalid, ensuring a clear communication channel between the application and the user.

Aesthetics: A visually appealing user interface, employing a colorful background, custom fonts, and a structured layout, ensuring that the application is not only functional but also visually pleasing.

Responsiveness: Through strategic use of layout managers, the application endeavors to remain visually coherent and usable across varying window sizes, ensuring usability across different screen dimensions and resolutions.
